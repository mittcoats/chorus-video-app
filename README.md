## Chorus Take home challenge

Using query param `ID = 4d79041e-f25f-421d-9e5f-3462459b9934`

And Chorus API endpoints:

transcript:
`https://static.chorus.ai/api<id>.json`

video: `https://static.chorus.ai/api<id>.mp4`

**TODO**: Build a single page web app using the Angular CLI with the following features
- A route to the video, that includes the Id in the url
- The HTML5 video tag to display the video, using the Id and chorus api endpoint
- A section displaying the transcript, sorted by time in ascending order

The transcipt object is shaped like this:
```
"snippet": 'the words they spoke',"speaker": 'This is the name of the speaker'
"time": 'Time in call when utterance happened.'
```

**Bonus Points**

Sometimes the speakers, have more than one utterance in a row. Combine them so the goes so it does speaker1, speaker2, speaker1 â€¦.
